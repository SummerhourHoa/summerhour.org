## Interested in helping?

We're open to volunteers from our community but keep in mind we have some strict guidelines:

- Keep it simple. If it doesn't fit in the free cloudflare and within the free github pages then we're not interested.
- All changes must pass an accessability check (WCAG) from <https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/> or similar tool.
- Keep it low maintenance. This mean minimal framework use, minimal packages, we don't have complex requirements.
